# DevTrack Frontend
The DevTrack Frontend repository contains the frontend code for the DevTrack web application. It is built using React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Zustand, and other relevant technologies, all written in TypeScript. 
The frontend is responsible for displaying the page content, handling user interactions, and making requests to the authentication and resource servers.

- Kanban Board: Display tasks in a kanban-style board with columns such as "Todo" and "Done."
- Task Management: Add, edit, and delete tasks with a title, description, and optional image upload.
- Drag and Drop: Enable drag and drop functionality to move tasks between columns using a user-friendly interface.
- Responsive Design: Ensure optimal user experience across different devices and screen sizes.
- AddTaskModal Component: Utilize Headless UI to create a modal component for displaying task details or additional actions.
## Technologies Used
- Next.js: React framework for building server-rendered and statically exported applications, written in TypeScript.
- React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces, written in TypeScript.
- Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- Zustand: Lightweight state management library for React applications, written in TypeScript.
- Headless UI: Collection of accessible and reusable UI components.
- TypeScript: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and maintainability.

## Important Note

**Please read this before accessing the website!**

**Server Startup Delay:** 

Please note that the resource-auth server for this website is hosted on a free instance on Render.com. As a result, there might be a delay of approximately 3 minutes when accessing the website for the first time or after a period of inactivity.The free hosting instance on Render.com may spin down after a period of inactivity, causing this initial delay. Subsequent accesses to the website will be instant once the server is up and running. I apologize for any inconvenience caused by this delay and appreciate your patience.
