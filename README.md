# DevTrack Frontend
The DevTrack Frontend repository contains the frontend code for the DevTrack web application. It is built using React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS and written in TypeScript. 
The frontend is responsible for displaying the page content, handling user interactions, and making requests to the authentication and resource servers.

## Important Note

**Please read this before accessing the website!**

**Server Startup Delay:** 

Please note that the resource-auth server for this website is hosted on a free instance on Render.com. As a result, there might be a delay of approximately 3 minutes when accessing the website for the first time however after that everything will work as intended. The free hosting instance on Render.com may spin down after a period of inactivity, causing this initial delay. Subsequent accesses to the website will be instant once the server is up and running. I apologize for any inconvenience caused by this delay and appreciate your patience.
