## Important Note

**Please read this before accessing the website!**

**Server Startup Delay:** 

Please note that the resource-auth server for this website is hosted on a free instance on Render.com. As a result, there might be a delay of approximately 3 minutes when accessing the website for the first time however after that everything will work as intended. The free hosting instance on Render.com may spin down after a period of inactivity, causing this initial delay. Subsequent accesses to the website will be instant once the server is up and running. I apologize for any inconvenience caused by this delay and appreciate your patience.
